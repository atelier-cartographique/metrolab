legends
=======

The Legend widget provide both a classic map legend, and the list of displayed layers. As such, it provides the ability to re-order the visible layers.


## Legend per layer 

- Each layer has it's own legend, automaticaly generated from the layer style (color gradient per attribut + attribut name, idem for outline strokes)


- The legend displays :
	- layer name 
	- layer description (?)
	- legend items



## Legend behaviour with several layers displayed

- If several layers are displayed (My Layers + Subscribed Layers), each legend is displayed in the same order as the layers.

- Each legend is collapsible (layer title remain visible)

- The legends list provide the list of the visible layers. We can use that to offer the possibility to re-order them (drag and drop or so..)



## Design : 

re-use the layer color somewhere for visual coherency.
