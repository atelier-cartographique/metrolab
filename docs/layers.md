layers
======

Layers are thematic maps created by users or out of imported datas.


## Layer creation

The user can add a new map layer to the collection by drawing his own map. 
The layer creation widget has to be designed to invite the user to create thematic layers (it can be with the label of the color choice...).


The user has to give it : 

- a name
- a description
- a style : 

	- The user can define the layer color. Gradients of that color will be generated from the entity attribut (=! number, to be defined).
	
	- Outlines of entities can have different strokes, depending of the entity attribut (number, to be defined)

- a group / create new group



## goodies

- Add ability to choose the background layer
